        <p id="paragraph">Since the commercialization of the Web, Web development has been a growing industry. The
            growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their Web site to advertise and sell
            products and services to customers.

            There are many open source tools for Web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache,
            MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning Web development to a minimum. Another
            contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG Web-development
            software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup
            Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be
            learned and implemented quickly.

            An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive Web
            sites. Further, Web developers now help to deliver applications as Web services which were traditionally
            only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to
            decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such
            as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive. These Web services allow users to interact with
            applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application
            environment.

            Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by Web development include e-commerce.
            Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services.
            Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and
            bargain-hunting experience for many consumers. Another example of transformative communication led by Web
            development is the blog. Web applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created blog-environments
            for individual Web sites. The increased usage of open-source content management systems and enterprise
            content management systems has extended Web development's impact at online interaction and communication.

            Web development has also impacted personal networking and marketing. Web sites are no longer simply tools
            for work or for commerce, but serve more broadly for communication and social networking. Web sites such as
            Facebook and Twitter provide users with a platform to communicate and organizations with a more personal and
            interactive way to engage the public.
